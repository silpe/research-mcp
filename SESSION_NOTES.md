# ResearchHub MCP Session Notes - December 20, 2024

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Enhanced PubMed Functionality
- **Major Change**: `pubmed_search` now returns full article details by default instead of just PMIDs
- Includes complete metadata: title, authors, abstract, journal, year, DOI, keywords
- Added formatted author lists (e.g., "Smith J, Jones A, Brown C et al.")
- Backward compatible with `return_details=False` parameter

### 2. Enhanced Semantic Scholar Features
- Added advanced search filters:
  - `year_range`: Filter papers by publication year (e.g., "2020-2024")
  - `min_citations`: Filter by minimum citation count
  - `fields_of_study`: Filter by research fields
- Enhanced output includes:
  - Citation metrics (total and influential citations)
  - Open access PDF links
  - Venue/journal information
  - Formatted author lists
  - Publication dates

### 3. New Combined Search Functions
- **`multi_database_search`**: Search PubMed, Semantic Scholar, arXiv, and CrossRef simultaneously
- **`get_paper_by_identifier`**: Auto-detect and retrieve papers using DOI, PMID, arXiv ID, or S2 ID

### 4. Deployment Fixes
- Fixed Python type hint compatibility issue (removed Union type)
- Added `runtime.txt` to specify Python 3.11.9
- Added `Procfile` for explicit startup command

## Current Status
- Code pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/silpe/research-mcp
- Render deployment: https://research-mcp.onrender.com
- MCP endpoint: https://research-mcp.onrender.com/mcp

## Testing the Improvements

Once deployed, test with these prompts:

```
Using the researchhub MCP server:

1. Search PubMed for "CRISPR gene therapy" and show the first 3 papers with authors and abstracts

2. Search Semantic Scholar for "machine learning" papers from 2023-2024 with at least 50 citations

3. Use multi_database_search to find papers about "COVID vaccine" across all databases

4. Get paper details for DOI 10.1038/nature12373
```

## Environment Variables in Render
Make sure these are set:
- `NCBI_API_KEY`: Your PubMed API key
- `S2_API_KEY`: Your Semantic Scholar API key  
- `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`: Your Reddit client ID
- `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Reddit client secret
- `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your secure authentication token

## Files Modified/Created
- `server.py`: Enhanced with new functionality
- `README.md`: Updated with new examples and features
- `IMPROVEMENTS.md`: Detailed list of enhancements
- `test_improvements.py`: Test script for new features
- `runtime.txt`: Python version specification
- `Procfile`: Render startup command
- Removed old files: server_enhanced.py, server_original.py, etc.

## MCP Registration (No Changes Needed)
Your MCP is already registered in Claude Code. The improvements will be available automatically once Render finishes deploying. No need to re-register or update the configuration.

## Troubleshooting
If deployment fails:
1. Check Render logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Ensure API keys are valid
4. The free tier may take 60s to wake up on first request

## Next Steps
1. Monitor Render deployment
2. Test the enhanced features
3. The enhanced search capabilities should make research much more efficient!
