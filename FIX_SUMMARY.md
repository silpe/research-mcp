# Research MCP Fix Summary

## Issue: 'FunctionTool' object is not callable

### Problem Description
When functions are decorated with `@mcp.tool` in the FastMCP framework, they are transformed into `FunctionTool` objects and are no longer directly callable as regular Python functions. This caused errors when:

1. Test scripts tried to call decorated functions directly
2. Other decorated functions tried to call decorated functions (e.g., `multi_database_search` calling other tool functions)

### Root Cause
The `@mcp.tool` decorator converts functions into Tool objects that implement the MCP (Model Context Protocol) interface. These Tool objects have a `run()` method for execution through the MCP protocol, but they cannot be called directly like regular functions.

### Solution Applied
Separated the implementation logic from the MCP tool decorators by creating internal implementation functions:

1. **For PubMed functions** (already done):
   - `_pubmed_search_impl()` - implementation function
   - `pubmed_search()` - MCP tool that calls the implementation

2. **For combined search functions** (fixed):
   - `_multi_database_search_impl()` - implementation function
   - `multi_database_search()` - MCP tool that calls the implementation
   - `_get_paper_by_identifier_impl()` - implementation function  
   - `get_paper_by_identifier()` - MCP tool that calls the implementation

### Pattern
```python
# Implementation function (can be called directly)
def _function_name_impl(args):
    # Actual logic here
    return result

# MCP tool decorator (creates Tool object)
@mcp.tool
def function_name(args):
    """Docstring for MCP clients"""
    return _function_name_impl(args)
```

### Benefits
1. Implementation functions can be called directly for testing
2. Tool functions can call other implementation functions without issues
3. Clear separation between business logic and MCP protocol layer
4. Easier to test and debug

### Testing
- Created `test_implementations.py` to test implementation functions directly
- All implementation functions work correctly when called directly
- MCP tools properly wrap the implementation functions for protocol use

### Files Modified
- `server.py`: Added `_multi_database_search_impl()` and `_get_paper_by_identifier_impl()`
- Created `test_implementations.py` for direct testing of implementation functions
- Created `test_fix_corrected.py` showing how to properly test Tool objects

### Note on Rate Limiting
The tests show some 429 (Too Many Requests) errors from PubMed API. This is due to rate limiting when NCBI_API_KEY is not set. Setting the environment variable `NCBI_API_KEY` with a valid API key will resolve this issue.
